# R Code for the creation of the insect bite force database

This repository contains the R code that was used to create the tables and figures of the article describing the insect bite force database published under

RÃ¼hr et al. (**in review**): A bite force database of 652 insect species.

## Instructions
1. Open the R project 'Bite_Force_Database.Rproj'. We have used RStudio [1] to run R [2]
2. Open the R script 'Bite_Force_Database.R'
3. Run the script

The script contains comments that explain the code step-by-step.

The Zenodo folder that is automatically downloaded by the script is available at [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5782922](https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5782922). Note that the Zenodo data must be unzipped after download so that all files are located in the same folder as the 'Bite_Force_Database.Rproj' file.

The Zenodo repository already contains all files that are produced by this script (mainly PDFs with plotted figures and the final database csv file 'iBite_table.csv'). Running this script will overwrite those files.
