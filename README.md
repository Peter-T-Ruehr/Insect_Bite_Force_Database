# R Code for the creation of the insect bite force database

This script was used to create the tables and figures of the article describing the insect bite force database published under

RÃ¼hr et al. (**in review**): A bite force database of 654 insect species.


## Instructions
1. Open the R project 'Bite_Force_Database.Rproj'
2. Open the R script 'Bite_Force_Database.R'

The Zenodo folder that is automatically downloaded (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.5782923) by this script already  contains all results of this script. Note that these files will be overwritten when this script is executed again.

We provided example code for those steps that have been performed once and need manual input from the user. Such code is commented out, because it may change the underlying data of this database.
